## 🧪 Development Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment

Create your `.env.local` file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Configure the GraphQL endpoint and your auth providers.

### 3. Generate GraphQL Types

```bash
npm run codegen
```

This uses the GraphQL schema from the running backend to generate fully typed `TypedDocumentNodes`.

### 4. Start the Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## 📡 Notes

* Uploads like **profile images** go through the GraphQL API using `apollo-upload-client`
* All large uploads (e.g., build media) use **S3 presigned URLs** via backend GraphQL resolvers
